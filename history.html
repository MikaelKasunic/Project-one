    <h2>So when and how did it all get started?</h2>
    <p>CrossFit, meaning cross-discipline fitness, was conceived as a company in 1996 as Cross-Fit. Greg Glassman and
        Lauren Jenai incorporated CrossFit Inc in 2000. They opened a gym in Santa Cruz, California and posted their
        workouts on the Internet for their clients, and these workouts were then quickly adopted by individuals in the
        police, military, firefighting services. The first affiliated gym (known as 'box') to form was CrossFit North in
        Seattle, Washington when Glassman's internet postings were used by those who wanted to officially incorporate
        his workouts into their training regimen in 2002. Glassman then began to develop a curriculum to train and
        certify coaches and gym owners using his methodology. There were 13 gyms by 2005, and in 2016 there were more
        than 13,000. By 2020, there were approximately 15,000 CrossFit affiliates around the world. Coaches associated
        with CrossFit include Louie Simmons, John Welbourn, and Bob Harper.

        Glassman obtained complete control over the company after a divorce with Jenai, who tried to sell her share in
        the company to an outside party after the divorce settlement, but Glassman bought it with a $16 million loan
        from Summit Partners.

        On June 24, 2020, following the outcry after Glassman's comments regarding the murder of George Floyd it was
        announced that he was selling the company to Eric Roza, a Colorado-based CrossFit box (gym) owner and former CEO
        of Datalogix. Roza announced he would be assuming the role of CEO after the conclusion of the sale in July. In
        late November, CrossFit announced a building lease for its Boulder headquarters.At the end of 2020, CrossFit
        became an LLC.</p>

    <h2>Crossfit Now</h2>
    <p>CrossFit is currently the number one brand of niche exercise across the globe. It focuses on combining
        conditioning with core strength while shaping all the important fitness focus areas. But you knew that already.

        You probably also know that CrossFit combines stamina, flexibility, speed, accuracy, power, strength,
        coordination, balance, agility, endurance, and cardio in one tough workout session.

        But what you might not know is that we would like to think that CrossFit is for everyone, but the truth is that
        not everyone is cut out to do CrossFit. And CrossFit is not for the weak-hearted. Opening your CrossFit gym will
        have you focusing on an exceptionally large, but unique niche market. A market with its own culture and energy.

        And even though a CrossFit gym looks a lot like a normal gym, it really is not. The world of CrossFit has its
        own lingo, fee structures, equipment, and certifications. And the best of all is that it is easy to set up if
        you know where to start and what to do.

        CrossFit might not be the exercise form for everyone, but those who love it and live it run super successful
        gyms across the world. The proof to this statement can be seen in the growth of this billion dollar industry.
